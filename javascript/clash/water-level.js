// Line 1: An integer n denotes the number of different levels
// Line 2: An integer m the number of readings from sensor
// Line 3: m space separated integer reading. A reading of -1 means water level is unspecified (i.e., water surface is between two levels).

//Output
// One line having m space separated integer water_level for corresponding sensor reading. If any reading can not specify the water level you have to print previous water_level


// Constraints
// 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 100
// -1 ≤ reading ≤ n-1; 1st reading will never be -1
// 0 ≤ water_level ≤ n-1
